1. Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects
directory, create nine empty fi les that are named house1, house2, house3, and so on to house9. Assuming there are lots of other files in that directory, come up with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine files.

kalina@PC-Kaly:~$ mkdir projects
kalina@PC-Kaly:~$ ls

kalina@PC-Kaly:~$ cd projects
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ touch house{1..9}
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ ls house*
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house6  house7  house8  house9



2. Make the $HOME/projects/houses/doors/ directory path. Create the following empty files within this directory path (try using absolute and relative paths from your home directory):
$HOME/projects/houses/bungalow.txt
$HOME/projects/houses/doors/bifold.txt
$HOME/projects/outdoors/vegetation/landscape.txt

kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ pwd
/home/kalina/projects/houses
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ mkdir doors
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ ls
doors
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ touch bungalow.txt
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ touch ./doors/bifold.txt
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ mkdir $HOME/projects/outdoors
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects/houses$ mkdir $HOME/projects/outdoors/vegetation



3. Copy the files house1 and house5 to the $HOME/projects/houses/ directory.

kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ pwd
/home/kalina/projects
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ cp -r house1 ./houses
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ cp -r house5 ./houses
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ ls
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house6  house7  house8  house9  houses  landscape.txt  outdoors
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ ls ./houses 
bungalow.txt  doors  house1  house5



4. Remove the files house6, house7, and house8 without being prompted.

kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ ls
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house6  house7  house8  house9  houses  landscape.txt  outdoors
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ rm house{6..8}
kalina@PC-Kaly:~/projects$ ls
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house9  houses  landscape.txt  outdoors
